# MandelbrotCompute

The Manelbrot set is the set of complex numbers $c \in \mathbb{C}$ for which the iterative sequence $z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c$, where $z_0 = 0$, does not diverge to infinity.

This repository aims to compute the members of the Mandelbrot set using various compute methods using fundamentally the same algorithm and then display it's members and the rate of divergence for boundry elements using SDL.
